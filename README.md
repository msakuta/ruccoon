# Ruccoon

A simple simulator game project demonstrating [Ruscal](https://github.com/msakuta/ruscal) scripting language.

Each agent (raccoon) walks around the map searching for food and once it gets one, it will return to a nest hole.

This project is a demonstration of utilizing a script language as a state machine description to design this kind of simulation easily.

## How to run

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
2. Run `cargo r`
